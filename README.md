## Ethical Considerations & Legal Compliance

### Authorization is Paramount

**Critical Requirement**: This tool must ONLY be used on systems where you have explicit, written authorization. Unauthorized scanning is illegal in most jurisdictions and may result in:
- Criminal charges under Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (US)
- Prosecution under Computer Misuse Act (UK)
- Civil liability for damages
- Professional certification revocation

### Professional Standards

As security professionals, we adhere to:
- **Rules of Engagement**: Clear scope definition before testing
- **Non-Disclosure**: Protecting client information
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Proper vulnerability reporting
- **Minimal Impact**: Avoiding service disruption

### Best Practices for Use

1. **Obtain Written Authorization**: Always document permission
2. **Define Clear Scope**: Know exactly what you're authorized to test
3. **Schedule Appropriately**: Minimize business impact
4. **Document Everything**: Maintain detailed logs
5. **Report Responsibly**: Follow proper disclosure procedures
